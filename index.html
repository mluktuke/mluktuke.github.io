        <h1>Hi, I'm Maithili Luktuke!</h1>
        <p>I am currently a first-year Computer Science and Engineering Master's student 
            at University of California, Santa Cruz studying computer science and 
            engineering. I plan to graduate in June of 2023. I enjoy problem-solving; making 
            challenging tasks fun and simple. I received a Bachelor of Science in 
            Computer Engineering from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. 
            During my academic career there I had the opportunity to participate in 
            some very interesting and challenging projects. 
        </p>
        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>My research interests include computer networking and IoT. I have taken 
            some networking classes during my Bachelors and am also taking a 
            Computer Networks class currently. I plan to take classes such
            as Wireless and Mobile Networks and High Speed Computer Networks so I can keep 
            increasing my knowledge about computer networking.
        </p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>In my senior project, during my Bachelors, I worked on researching SDNs and the issues
            that currently exist with its security. My team and I worked to build a network, attack 
            it, and then mitigate the attack. We worked with a Cisco Catalyst 2960X series switch, 
            Raspberry Pis, a Mac mini, and our personal laptops to act as clients and controllers 
            connected via the ethernet ports of the switch.
            
            I also worked with a team to research different computer vision algorithms that exist in 
            OpenCV and test their performance on a Raspberry Pi. We went on to present this project at
            the 8th Annual Student RSCA Conference.
